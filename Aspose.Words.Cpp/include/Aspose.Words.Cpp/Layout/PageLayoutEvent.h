/// First, "conversion step", this is when page layout pulls document content and creates object graph.
/// Second, "reflow step", this is when structures are split, merged and arranged into pages.
/// Depending of the operation which triggered build, page layout model may or may not be further rendered into fixed page format.
/// For example, computing number of pages in the document or updating fields does not require rendering, whereas export to Pdf does.
