/// Specifies how formatting is merged when importing content from another document.
/// 
/// When you copy nodes from one document to another, this option specifies how formatting
/// is resolved when both documents have a style with the same name, but different formatting.
/// 
/// The formatting is resolved as follows:
/// 
/// -# Built-in styles are matched using their locale independent style identifier.
///    User defined styles are matched using case-sensitive style name.
/// -# If a matching style is not found in the destination document, the style
///    (and all styles referenced by it) are copied into the destination document
///    and the imported nodes are updated to reference the new style.
/// -# If a matching style already exists in the destination document, what happens
///    depends on the <c>%importFormatMode</c> parameter passed to
///    <see cref="Aspose::Words::DocumentBase::ImportNode(System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Node>, bool, Aspose::Words::ImportFormatMode)">Document.ImportNode</see>
///    as described below.
/// 
/// When using the <b>%UseDestinationStyles</b> option, if a matching style already exists
/// in the destination document, the style is not copied and the imported nodes are updated
/// to reference the existing style.
/// 
/// The drawback of using <b>%UseDestinationStyles</b> is that the imported text might
/// look different in the destination document comparing to the source document.
/// For example, the "Heading 1" style in the source document uses Arial 16pt font and
/// the "Heading 1" style in the destination document uses Times New Roman 14pt font.
/// When importing text of "Heading 1" style with no other direct formatting, it will
/// appear as Times New Roman 14pt font in the destination document.
/// 
/// <b>%KeepSourceFormatting</b> option allows to make sure the imported content looks the same
/// in the destination document like it looks in the source document.
/// If a matching style already exists in the destination document, the source style formatting is expanded
/// into direct Node attributes and the style is changed to Normal.
/// If the style does not exist in the destination document, then the source style is imported
/// into the destination document and applied to the imported node.
/// Note, that it is not always possible to preserve the source style even if it does not exist in the destination document.
/// In this case formating of such style will be expanded into direct Node attributes in favor of preserving original Node formatting.
/// 
/// The drawback of using <b>%KeepSourceFormatting</b> is that if you perform several imports,
/// you could end up with many styles in the destination document and that could make using
/// consistent style formatting in %Microsoft Word difficult for this document.
/// 
/// Using <b>%KeepDifferentStyles</b> option allows to reuse destination styles
/// if the formatting they provide is identical to the styles in the source document.
/// If the style in destination document is different from the source then it is imported.
///
